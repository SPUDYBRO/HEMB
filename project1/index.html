                    "create me a hero image for my website hero image, with a modern simplistic feel for the website
                    1. IT Support company
                    2. A man in a suit

                    4. abstract or somthing"

                    reason for using GEN AI to create image:
                        1. our team does not have the graphic design skills to create a hero image
                        2. our team does not have the time to create a hero image
                        3. our team does not have the budget to pay someone to create a hero image
