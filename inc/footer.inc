        <!-- mostly generated by chatgpt 
            prompt provided: make this better but keep it short because its in the footer
            what was there before:
            HEMB IT solutions
            We will fix anything!
            Add some stuff here, talking about the company or what ever

            reason why i generated it:
                i couldn't think of anything to say, and i wanted to make it longer
                i also wanted to make it sound more professional and less like a 5 year old wrote it :p
                again, same reasons as before XD
